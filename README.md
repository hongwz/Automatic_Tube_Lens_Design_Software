# Automatic_Tube_Lens_Design_Software
This software is used to automatically design microscope tube lenses with a pair of stock achromatic doublets.
Software packages were produced with both Matlab 2016b and 2019a. 

# Catalogue Generator
Input a focal length range, a lens diameter range and select lens vendors, then the Catalogue Generator will produce a doublet catalogue from the OpticStudio lens database.
This catalogue can be directly used in the Doublet Selector.

Doublet Selector 1.1 is produced to be used with Zemax version before 20.2 without CARD operand.
